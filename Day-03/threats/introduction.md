# Introduction to Cyber Threats

Cyber threats are malicious acts that seek to damage data, steal data, or disrupt digital life in general. They include threats like malware, phishing, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

## Common Cyber Threats
- **Malware**: Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise a computer system.
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.
- **SQL Injection**: A code injection technique that might destroy your database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A security vulnerability typically found in web applications.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: An attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application.
- **DDoS Attacks**: An attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.
